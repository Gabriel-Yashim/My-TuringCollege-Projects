# Title: Statistical Inference & A/B Testing for Marketing Campaigns  

## My Project Solution

In this project, I analyzed an A/B test dataset to evaluate the performance of three marketing campaigns and provided data-driven recommendations. The dataset was aggregated by `LocationID`, `PromotionID`, and week, and I further aggregated it by `LocationID` and `PromotionID` to prepare for statistical testing.

Key steps included:  
1. **Pairwise Comparisons:** Conducted pairwise comparisons to evaluate the performance of each campaign against the others.  
2. **Addressing Multiple Testing:** To mitigate the risk of type I errors (false positives) due to multiple tests, I used a 99% confidence level instead of the traditional 95%.  
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Performed statistical tests to identify the best-performing campaign based on the provided data.  

The findings and recommendations are documented in the file, findit by following the link below:
