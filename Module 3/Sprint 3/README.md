### **Overview**  
This project refines Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) calculations by incorporating a cohort-based approach for greater accuracy and actionable insights. Using data from the `turing_data_analytics.raw_events` table, I adjusted the methodology to account for all user registrations and evaluated weekly customer behavior over a 12-week period.

### **Steps Taken**  

1. **Adjusting User Scope**  
   - Expanded the analysis to include all users who registered on the ecommerce site, not just those who made a purchase.  
   - Treated the first recorded event for each user as their "registration" date, ensuring consistency with marketing metrics.

2. **Cohort Definition and Analysis**  
   - Defined weekly cohorts based on the userâ€™s registration week, with the last cohort date being 2021-01-24.  
   - Calculated cumulative revenue generated by each cohort over a 12-week period, considering the short customer retention period typical for the ecommerce site.

3. **Revenue Attribution and CLV Calculation**  
   - Aggregated revenue data for each cohort by week, calculating metrics such as:
     - Total revenue per cohort.
     - Average revenue per user in each cohort.
     - Weekly CLV trends, capturing customer behavior across their lifecycle.

4. **Actionable Insights**  
   - Identified key trends in user engagement and revenue contribution by cohort.  
   - Highlighted opportunities for improving retention or marketing strategies based on observed drop-offs.
