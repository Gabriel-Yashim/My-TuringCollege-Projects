# Title: First Steps Into Programming

### Chess Capture Analysis Program  

This project is a Python-based program designed to analyze a chessboard scenario and determine which black pieces a given white piece can capture based on their positions.  

#### **Overview**  
1. **User Input for White Piece:**  
   - The program begins by prompting the user to specify a white chess piece (e.g., pawn or rook) and its position on the board using a predefined format (e.g., `knight a5`).  

2. **User Input for Black Pieces:**  
   - The user then enters the positions of 1 to 16 black chess pieces, one at a time, in the same format.  
   - The input process ends when the user types "done" after adding at least one black piece.  

3. **Validation and Feedback:**  
   - Each input is validated to ensure correctness, including position format and rules for when input can end.  
   - Feedback is provided after every input, either confirming successful addition or explaining errors.

4. **Capture Calculation:**  
   - After all pieces are added, the program calculates and displays which black pieces, if any, can be captured by the white piece based on chess movement rules.  

This project demonstrates my skills in input validation, logical problem-solving, and implementing chess rules in Python, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
