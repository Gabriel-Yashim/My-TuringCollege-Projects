# Title: Machine Learning

### Project Overview  

In this project, I analyzed data and built a logistic regression model to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Using a structured approach, I:  

- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and its key features.  
- Developed a logistic regression model for CHD risk prediction.  
- Selected the most suitable classification metric for this healthcare problem and calculated the optimal decision threshold.  
- Provided a detailed rationale for the chosen metric and threshold, focusing on its relevance to the context of predicting CHD risk.  

This project demonstrates my ability to apply machine learning techniques, evaluate model performance, and make data-driven decisions in a healthcare context.
