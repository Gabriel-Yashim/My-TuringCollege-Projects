# Title: Data Processing with Pandas

## Overview

As part of this project, I analyzed the **Top 50 Spotify Tracks of 2020** dataset to showcase my data analysis skills and proficiency with Python's Pandas library. Acting as a data analyst for Spotify, my goal was to explore and quantify the elements that contribute to a hit song.

In this scenario, I collaborated with my team’s product manager, who provided a comprehensive list of over 20 questions regarding the characteristics of top tracks. Leveraging a pre-prepared dataset shared by an experienced colleague, I conducted a detailed analysis to answer these questions and uncover additional insights.

This project allowed me to demonstrate my abilities in:
- Applying advanced data analysis techniques to real-world datasets.
- Extracting actionable insights about hit songs using descriptive and exploratory analysis.
- Organizing and presenting findings in a clear and concise manner.

The analysis not only addressed the provided questions but also went beyond, revealing additional patterns and trends within Spotify’s top hits.
