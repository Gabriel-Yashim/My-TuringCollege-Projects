# Title: Data Visualization with Python


## **Overview**

In this project, I applied the skills Iâ€™ve gained in data analysis and visualization to explore and analyze the Coursera Course Dataset. Without explicit instructions, I relied on my own judgment to identify key areas of interest, formulate hypotheses, and investigate them through iterative analysis. This project allowed me to demonstrate my ability to independently conduct data-driven exploration, communicate insights visually, and refine my analytical thinking. While this project reflects a step in my ongoing learning journey, it highlights my capacity to apply foundational data analysis techniques to real-world datasets.
