# About  this project


This project though more advance then the previous, aimed to also test my SQL skills and how I could interprete real life problems into code logic. For this project I worked with the <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms' target='_blank'>Adventureworks 2005 database</a> where I identified the needed data and the correct way to get it/merge it together with other tables within this database.

I created queries to solve specific business questions with two main questions with this project:

### 1.1 

### 2.1
