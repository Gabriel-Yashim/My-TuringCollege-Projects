# Title: SQL & Databases

## About  this project

This project aimed to test my SQL skills and how I could interprete real life problems into code logic. For this project I worked with the <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms' target='_blank'>Adventureworks 2005 database</a> where I identified the needed data and the correct way to get it/merge it together with other tables within this database.

I answered three main questions with this project:

### 1.1 Here, I was expected to extract the data on products from the Product table where there exists a product subcategory. And also include the name of the ProductSubcategory. 

### 1.2 I imporved the previous querry by adding more data about the product

### 1.3 Here, I filtered the output from the previous query by the price of the bikes

### 2.1 Here, I made use of aggregates (SUM, GROUPBY) to get data from the 'workoderrouting' table within a specific time period (January 2004)

### 2.2 Here, I improved on the previous query by adding the location name and calculating the average days between actual start date and actual end date for each location.

### 2.3 Here, I filtered out the expensive orders (above 300 actual cost) within a specific time period (January 2004)

### 3. This part of the project was focussed on code validation, basically checking the logic and correctness of the queries.
