# Title: Presentations & Soft Skills


## About This Project

In this project, I focused on creating tailored presentations and dashboards for two distinct audiences: executives and department leads. Here’s how I approached the task:

1. **Executive Presentation:**
   - I designed a high-level, strategic presentation that communicated the problem, its significance, and how the proposed solution aligned with the organization’s goals.
   - The focus was on the big picture, emphasizing key performance metrics and conducting a cost-benefit analysis to demonstrate the value of the solution.

2. **Department Lead Presentation:**
   - I developed a more detailed and tactical presentation tailored to department leads. This version highlighted the impact of the analysis on their specific areas and outlined how their teams could contribute to the solution's success.
   - The presentation addressed the roles and responsibilities of department leads, along with strategies for cross-department collaboration to achieve the project’s objectives.

3. **Dashboard Design:**
   - I created a core dashboard that visualized the essential data and insights. To suit the needs of each audience, I slightly modified the dashboard for each presentation, ensuring it effectively communicated the relevant insights.

4. **Audience-Centric Approach:**
   - Throughout the project, I focused on preparing presentations and dashboards that aligned with the audience’s priorities and preferences. My goal was to go beyond presenting raw data by delivering actionable insights in a clear and impactful way.

This project demonstrates my ability to adapt communication styles, visualize data effectively, and provide meaningful insights to drive decision-making.
